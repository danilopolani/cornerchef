- We're in a Expo 53 mobile app. We're using React Native and TypeScript.
- We're using Nativewind for styling with Tailwind v3.
- We're using Expo Router for navigation.
- We're using React Native Reanimated for animations.
- Always follow the Expo best practices and don't use custom solutions if not really needed.
- Always use Expo plugins and modules if possible.
- Always use Expo CLI to perform operations such as installing dependencies, building the app, etc.
